We have our basic human needs for food, water and shelter. We tend to also wish to attract a sexual partner. We’re very sociable and image conscious, and have an urge to prove our worth and status to one another through acquisition of material goods.  In the western world they use a lot of energy to maintain their way of life and their high consumption rates. 
We have a huge impact on the natural environment; it’s hard to think of an ecosystem we don’t affect in a negative way.<img src=image/want1.jpg width="300" height="200" align="left"></img><p>



Our food system has a huge impact on the natural environment. Modern farming systems are highly energy and water intensive and, many argue, unsustainable. Delivery and production tend to use vast amounts of non-renewable fossil fuels.
Extraction and delivery of these fuels often scars the landscape and destroys critical wildlife habitats (see tar sands). The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. The manufacture of fertilizer, the operation of farm machinery plus plastic packaging and the delivery of our food usually require fossil fuels.<p> 




We also use a lot of synthetic chemicals in food production. Runoff from fields that have been treated with pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers leads to pollution of our waters and numerous ecological issues (algal blooms etc.).  These chemicals also contribute to the decimation of the pollinator populations we depend upon. <p>


We pollute our water with all sorts of things including plastics, various pharmaceuticals and personal care products, and our land with toxic chemicals and radioactive material. Cities are a significant source of noise and light pollution that can disrupt natural behavior of numerous species.<p>

 We happily dispose our products (phones, TVs etc.) upon release of a new model. Some products have built-in obsolescence, so you're guaranteed to be buying another washing machine/computer/oven within 5 years of the initial purchase. The manufacturer wins, the environment loses.<p>

 We have introduced non-native or invasive species of plants and animals- sometimes deliberately, sometimes accidentally, but usually with dire consequences. Invasive species frequently out-compete native species (e.g. the American grey squirrel out-competing the native red squirrel in the UK) and spread like wildfire. Speaking of which, we've altered fire ecology, too. <p>

Our need for food and shelter, plus our dependence upon fossil fuels, has led to dramatic deforestation. Forests are vital habitats for numerous species but also act as the lungs of our planet, producing oxygen and sequestering carbon. Burning forests emit methane and carbon dioxide.<p>






 


Our way of life increases species extinction rates (above the natural or ‘background’ rate), pollutes, and changes/destroys/fragments many ecosystems. We are altering our climate through the emission of greenhouse gases. We’re rather short sighted, rarely thinking very far beyond our own lifespan. As we seek to address our immediate, short-term needs and wants, we act to the detriment of the planet and the lives of future human beings. With greater knowledge of our impact, many of us are working to reduce our individual 'ecological footprint' for the good of the environment and, by extension, ourselves.<BR>
